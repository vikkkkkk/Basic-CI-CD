Hello everybody
I'm doing a (free) operating         system
14567892-=


    (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu) for
386(486) AT clones.
    This has been brewing since april, and is starting to get ready.
I'd like any feedback on things people like/dislike in minix



as my OS resembles it somewhat
(same physical layout of the file-system 
(due to practical reasons)
AMONG OTHER THINGS).
